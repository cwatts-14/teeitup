## 🎯 System Overview

The Work Order Indexing System is a comprehensive solution for discovering, indexing, and managing work orders from the Factory.8090.ai service. It provides:

- **Automatic Discovery**: Browser automation to discover work orders from 8090 integrations
- **Full-Text Search**: Powerful search capabilities across work order content
- **Status & Priority Filtering**: Advanced filtering by status, priority, assignee, and tags
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for easy management
- **Export/Import**: Complete data portability with JSON export/import
- **Real-time Statistics**: Comprehensive monitoring and reporting

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Index Work Orders**:
   ```bash
   python work_order_cli.py index --export work_orders.json
   ```

3. **Search Work Orders**:
   ```bash
   python work_order_cli.py search "urgent bug fix"
   ```

4. **View Statistics**:
   ```bash
   python work_order_cli.py stats
   ```

## 📊 Key Features

### 🔍 Discovery & Indexing
- Browser automation with Playwright
- API endpoint discovery

### 🔎 Search & Filtering
- Full-text search across titles, descriptions, and tags
- Status filtering (queued, in_progress, completed, etc.)
- Priority filtering (low, medium, high, urgent, critical)
- Assignee and tag-based filtering

### 📈 Statistics & Reporting
- Real-time work order statistics
- Status and priority distribution
- Assignment tracking
- Search index metrics

### 💾 Data Management
- JSON export/import functionality
- Complete data serialization
- Backup and restore capabilities

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**: Core runtime
- **Playwright**: Browser automation
- **httpx**: HTTP client for API calls
- **structlog**: Structured logging
- **pydantic**: Data validation
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous programming

## 📋 Work Order Status & Priority

### Status Values
- `queued` - Work order is queued for processing
- `in_progress` - Work order is currently being worked on
- `completed` - Work order has been completed
- `failed` - Work order failed during processing
- `cancelled` - Work order was cancelled
- `pending_approval` - Work order is waiting for approval
- `on_hold` - Work order is temporarily on hold

### Priority Values
- `low` - Low priority work order
- `medium` - Medium priority work order
- `high` - High priority work order
- `urgent` - Urgent work order
- `critical` - Critical work order

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Credential Management**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect service limits and implement backoff
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs
